**About Ebenezer**
------------------

[Ebenezer: A Journal of Public Theology & Public Witness](/) is a home for writing that speaks to public life with moral clarity and scholarly care.

We publish work that helps readers think and act in the world. We welcome scholars, pastors, organizers, artists, and public writers. We value work that can hold faith and critique together, and that treats communities with respect.

### **Our identity**

Ebenezer is:

-   **International in scope**

-   **Ecumenical in heritage**

-   **Inter-religious in outlook**

-   **Inclusive by design**

We believe public theology is not only for the academy. It belongs in congregations, classrooms, community meetings, courtrooms, kitchens, and streets.

### **What we publish**

We publish pieces that are strong in argument, clear in style, and grounded in real public questions, such as:

-   democracy and public life

-   race, empire, and colonialism

-   war, peace, and nonviolence

-   climate, land, water, and place

-   economic justice and labor

-   migration and borders

-   gender and sexuality

-   technology, media, and public discourse

-   memory, history, and repair

Formats may include:

-   essays and short articles

-   field reports and public scholarship

-   interviews and conversations

-   book reviews

-   classroom-ready resources

-   sermons, prayers, and liturgies (when offered as public witness)

-   special series and themed clusters

### **Our commitments**

Ebenezer is shaped by a few simple commitments:

-   **Truthfulness.** We do not publish work that spreads misinformation or targets groups for harm.

-   **Care in language.** We write so people can read, teach, and share the work.

-   **Accountability.** We welcome critique and correction.

-   **Respect for living traditions.** We do not treat communities as raw material for ideas.

-   **Public purpose.** We publish for the sake of the world, not only for career advancement.

### **Editorial approach**

We use an editorial process that matches the piece and its purpose.

-   Some work receives **editorial review** and close editing for clarity and structure.

-   Some work may be sent for **peer review** when the genre and claim call for it.

-   We also publish timely public writing that needs a faster path to release.

In every case, we aim for a process that is fair, transparent, and rigorous.

### **Accessibility and reach**

We want Ebenezer to be readable and shareable.

-   We prioritize plain language and strong structure.

-   We design for mobile reading.

-   When possible, we support audio-friendly formats and public-facing summaries.

### **Submit or get involved**

If you want to write for Ebenezer, pitch a piece, propose a series, or volunteer as a reviewer or editor, contact the journal team through the website's submission or contact page.

We especially welcome:

-   first-time public writers

-   graduate students and early career scholars

-   community-based scholars and organizers

-   voices often kept out of "official" conversations

Ebenezer exists because public witness still matters.
